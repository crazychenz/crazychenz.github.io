## 5 Hour Rule

Bits Of Wisdom:

* Schedule time for deliberate learning.
* Schedule slack time into daily schedule for learning and quality improvement.
* Deliberate practice time (in contrast to learning from a goal.)
* Set learning goals separate from goals to get some work complete.
* Retrospectives.
* Ruminate - Retrospective and review through walking.
* Observe others (without an agenda outside of learning.)
* *Outside Of Learning*: Solve problems as they arise. Do no defer.

## Surface Knowledge vs Deep Knowledge

Surface knowledge is a new feature or widget.

Deep knowledge is timeless (e.g. design patterns, established standards).

## Grid Movement with Physics

I keep finding holes in the block pushing of Potty Time. Its gotten to the point where I don't want to spend anymore time on what I was sure was a simple thing. Instead, I'm looking into just linking in box2d into my application and using it to determine the cascade of moved/affected blocks.

The first thing I've noticed when looking into this is that the developer of box2d also has a box2d-lite. The lite version is very light but may actually suit my purposes without all the baggage of the full version. My only reluctance is that I want to know the performance is reasonable, even in my super simply case.

Setting up several fail gates here:

* First fail gate is going to be building box2d and box2d-lite as static libraries in Scons.
* Second fail gate is going to be setting up a number of tests to measure the performance of box2d and box2d-lite for my use cases.
* Third fail gate is going to be comparing the size of full box2d to box2d lite. There is a balance between performance and size in this case. If the performance difference between the two is very small, but full box2d adds a significant size, I'll likely choose box2d lite.

After picking the best implementation, the plan is to create bodies for each entity on the board. When the player moves, an impulse will be applies to the adjacent body and we'll simulate for a single step. The step time delta needs to be sufficiently large enough to determine if the effected bodies were actually able to move into an adjacent square. I can think of some weird edge cases where the naive approach will fail, but for the more simple use cases, this should suffice until the problem is better understood. The complete time step should occur within a single input Action and then all blocks detected as moved *enough* will be added to the output Action list.

Tangent Note: Someone mentioned sliding based on off center raycasts that indicate if we want to slide one direction or another OR if we want to push up against the object without sliding.
